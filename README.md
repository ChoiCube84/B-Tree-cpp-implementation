# B Tree Implementation in C++
This repository contains a basic implementation of a B Tree data structure in C++. Born out of a sense of revenge following a failed assignment during a Data Structure class, this project aims to provide a clean, simple, and understandable implementation of a B Tree.

# Revenge Story
The initial inspiration for this project came from a Data Structures assignment, which involved implementing a B Tree. Unfortunately, the original assignment didn't go as planned, but failure isn't the end. It's a chance to learn and grow. Hence, this project is a testament to the spirit of learning and improvement.

# Project Overview
B Trees are a type of self-balancing search tree that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. They're widely used in systems that read and write large blocks of data, like databases and file systems.

This project is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, ensuring the code is modular, easy to understand, and flexible to changes.

# Features
The B Tree implementation supports the following operations:

1. Insertion: Add keys into the B Tree while maintaining its properties. (Not Implemented Yet)
2. Deletion: Remove keys from the B Tree while maintaining its properties. (Not Implemented Yet)
3. Search: Find if a key exists in the B Tree. (Not Implemented Yet)
4. Traversal: Traverse through the keys in the B Tree. (Not Implemented Yet)
